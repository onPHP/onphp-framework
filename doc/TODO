* views: improved hierarchy, ex: relative 'parts', absolute '/parts', parent
'../parts'.  see urls transformation in GenericUri for logic.

* primitives refactoring:

form2object: maybe always use getValue, why lists are special?

define SimpleType and ComplexType interfaces (to use setter or dropper in b/o)

anonymous primitives (split fields and types).
Such primitives cannot be required or optional - it's field property
(case: we want to set field type but do not know, it is required or optional)

make uniform lists: PrimitiveList()->of(AnonymousPrimitive)

* application:

RequestUrl: aggregator for subdomain, subpath, and query vars.

ApplicationRequest: request DTO.

NavigationSchema: xsd-based rewriter for RequestUrl <-> ApplicationRequest.

ApplicationUrl: factory for easy producing urls of any kind.

ApplicationController: Controller implementation for ApplicationRequest.

ApplicationModel: response, anotated with xsd.
